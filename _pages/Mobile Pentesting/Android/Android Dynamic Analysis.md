# Dynamic Analysis
---
It's about testing and evaluating a program while software is running.

## SSL pinning
---
Security methodology to ensure that app's traffic isn't being intercepted (prevent from Man In The Middle)
Traffic is verified using certificate
Even if we can import certificate into phone the apps may not trust this certificate

- Proxies
    - Burpsuite (common)
    - Proxyman (used on MACOS only)

even when you configure the proxy and add the certificate, some apps may not work.
because apps won't be able to authenticate the server (which is burp in this case)

There are many ways to bypass SSL like Frida, objection.
