# Static Analysis
---
It's about examining the code without executing the program

We are going to see the important files within the android application and how can we benefit from them

## Android Manifest.xml
---
It contains the basic info about the application
- minSDKVersion

- Permissions
What data & HW components the app needs access to: (camera, BT, internet, etc..)
You can see list of permissions <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission">here</a>

- Activities
UI element that represents screens in the application (some of them need to be protected)
protection is done using **intent-filters** which says (before you go to this screen you need to go to through this screen based on factors like cookies)
`exported="True"` means that this activity is exposed and can be accessed from outside the app

- Content Providers
serve data from ur app to other apps
exported content provider can be very dangerous and expose data to any user or app
the xml tag is `provider`

You may find API keys defined
At the top of the manifest you can see `backup` option



## Common Application Strings
---
We may find useful strings to get more info

- Hardcoded Strings
can be found in: `resources/strings.xml`, `activity source code`
we may find: `login creds`, `api key`, `exposed url`, `firebase URLs`
